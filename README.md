# Asteroid Miner

This game was made for the [31st Ludum Dare 48-Hour Game Making Jam/Compo](http://ludumdare.com/compo/).

It was entirely made with 48 hours!

To play it, you will need to use [Love2D (0.9.1)](https://love2d.org/).


## Game play

The point of the game is to collect the *square* resources (redder ones are worth
less than greener ones), and avoid the asteroids by flying around them or
destroying them with your laser cannon.

## Controls

  * *space bar*: fire your laser cannon!
  * *up*: engage your engine for thrust!
  * *left*: rotate your ship counter-clockwise!
  * *right*: rotate your ship clockwise!

## Resources used that were not made _explicitly_ within the 48-hour timeframe:

    (pre-made fonts are allowed)

## A note about sound

This game _does_ use sound, and does not provide anyway of disabling it, sorry!
You'll need to mute your headphones/speakers if you wish to not hear any sounds
while you play.
